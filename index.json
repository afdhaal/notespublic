Branches of the axillary artery supplies the chest wall and the shoulder.  1st part: Superior thoracic artery. 2nd part: Acromiothoracic trunk, Lateral thoracic artery 3rd part: Subscapular artery, Anterior, and posterior circumflex humeral artery. All but circumflex humeral vessels are encountered in the axillary dissection of a radical mastectomy.    The brachial artery  Commences in the arm at lower border of latissimus dorsi.

Distally in forearm radial artery lies between BR and FCR It gives off branches to form the superficial palmar arch. Then it enters anatomical snuff box by passing under the tendons of APL and EPB. Then it passes in between 1st and 2nd MC to pierce the first dorsal IO and adductor pollicis to form the deep palmar arch.  The ulnar artery  Larger of two terminal branches of the brachial artery.

It lies upon FDP and overlapped by FCU The median nerve crosses superficially to the ulnar artery separated from the deep head of pronator teres. The distal half of the forearm lies in between FCU and FDS. Then it crosses the flexor retinaculum to form the superficial palmar arch.
